# XHS Release Video Guidelines

## Frame and Layout
- Aspect ratio: `9:16`
- Render size: `1080x1920`
- Content safe area: middle `2/3` vertically
- Content must be visually centered (not drifting low)

## Visual Style
- Prefer premium gradient backgrounds with subtle glow layers.
- Default strategy: one unified palette across the full video.
- Optional strategy: rotate themes per scene if user asks.
- Keep section card style consistent: icon, title, divider, 3-5 bullet rows.

## Typography
- Prioritize mobile readability (large type + clear line-height).
- Section bullets should use rounded mini-card rows, not dense raw lists.
- Mixed English tokens in Chinese lines can be highlighted for scannability.

## Motion
- Simple motion only: fade + slight translate.
- Scene start must not be pure background; content should be visible from frame 0.
- Keep pacing stable (e.g., 5 scenes * 120 frames).

## Delivery Checklist
1. Export still previews first (cover + section).
2. Confirm vertical centering and text readability.
3. Render final MP4.
4. Return MP4 path and preview image paths.
